She has studied trumpet with Wayne Cook and Kevin Hartman and conducting with Thomas Dvorak and John Climer. Ms. Wicihowski taught for six years in the Palmyra-Eagle Area School District, where she built the band program to include a fully comprehensive band program, with marching and concert performances on the state and national levels.<br><br>

As a free-lance trumpet player, “Ms. W.” continues to be active in appearances all over southeastern Wisconsin, including performances with the Waukesha Symphony Orchestra, Violent Femmes and Gilberto Santa Rosa. 
Ms. W married her best friend in the summer of 2010 and revitalized her passion in Reggae music while honeymooning in Jamaica!! In her spare time, Ms. Wicihowski loves to watch major league baseball (Milwaukee Brewers, Boston Red Sox), college football (Georgia Bulldogs, Clemson Tigers, Iowa Hawkeyes) and of course the Green Bay Packers.
