      ABOUT UWAY/UJAY<br>
 
The Nathan Hale Band is proud to support both UWAY and UJAY, UWM's Youth Instrumental Ensembles.<br>

The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Youth Music Ensembles program is an out-reach program of the Peck School of the Arts Department of Music. Founded in 1982 as the Greater Milwaukee Youth Wind Ensemble, Professor Emeritus Thomas Dvorak founded the program with one youth wind ensemble. Since then, the UWM Youth Music Ensembles have become nationally and internationally accomplished, has included offerings in wind ensembles, jazz ensembles, chamber music, and percussion. The program is recognized as an integral co-curricular component of the Peck School of the Arts, and UWAY/UJAY participants have the opportunity to work with UWM Music Faculty and Staff, and gain the invaluable experience of furthering their musicianship by performing in a university setting. The Youth Music Ensembles program is sponsored by the UWM Department of Music and University Bands, and works in cooperation with Wisconsin high school music programs. It currently includes Youth Wind Ensembles, Youth Chamber Winds and Youth Jazz Ensembles. <br><br>

The UWM Youth Music Ensembles program is designed to supplement the fine instruction students receive from their school music programs and private music instructors by providing them with musical experiences that include: performing symphonic and chamber wind-band or jazz big-band and combo repertoire with their student peers from all over Southeastern Wisconsin, being led and inspired by the creative artist-faculty, and working closely with other musical members of the University community. <br><br>
